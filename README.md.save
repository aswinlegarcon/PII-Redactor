# PII Redactor Prototype

### Overview

The PII Redactor is a Python-based tool designed to redact Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from sensitive documents. The current prototype supports the redaction of Aadhaar card information and PII from PDF documents, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations and protecting sensitive data.

### Features

- **Aadhaar Redaction**: Redacts Aadhaar numbers and related PII from Aadhaar card documents.
- **PDF Redaction**: Identifies and redacts PII (names, addresses, phone numbers, etc.) from PDF files.
- **In Development**: Future updates will include broader document support and more complex redaction rules.

### Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary language used for processing and redaction logic.
- **PDF Processing Libraries**: `PyPDF2` (or `pdfplumber`) for reading PDF files.
- **Regex**: Regular expressions for identifying PII in text.
- **Machine Learning (Future)**: Potential ML models for detecting sensitive data in more complex formats.
